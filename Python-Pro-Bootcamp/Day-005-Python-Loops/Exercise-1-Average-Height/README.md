# Exercise 1 - Average Height

## Instructions
You are going to write a protgram that calculates the average student height from a List of heights. The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights

e.g.

180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = **1146**

There are a total of **7** heights in student_heights.

1146 รท 7 = **163.71428571428572**

Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = **164**

**Important:** You should not use the <code>sum()</code> or <code>len()</code> functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

## Example Input
```
156 178 165 171 187
```
In this case, student_heights would be a list that looks like: [156, 178, 165, 171, 187]

## Example Output
```
171
```
e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:
