# Exercise 1 - Squaring Numbers

## Instructions
You are going to write a List Comprehension to create a new list called <code>squared_numbers</code>: This new list should contain every number in the list <code>numbers</code> but each number should be squared.

e.g.
```
4 * 4 = 16
```

4 squared equals 16.

**DO NOT** modify the List <code>numbers</code> directly. Try to use **List Comprehension** instead of a **Loop**.

## Example Output
```
[1, 1, 4, 9, 25, 64, 169, 441, 1156, 3025]
```
