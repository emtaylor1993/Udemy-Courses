# Exercise 3 - Data Overlap

## Instructions
Take a look inside **file1.txt** and **file2.txt**. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.

You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbesr that are **common** in both files.

e.g. if file1.txt contained:
```
1
2
3
```

and file2.txt contained:
```
2
3
4
```

result = <code>2, 3</code>

**IMPORTANT**: The result should be in a list that contains **Integers**, not **Strings**. Try to use **List Comprehension** instead of a **Loop**.

## Example Output
```
[3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]
```
