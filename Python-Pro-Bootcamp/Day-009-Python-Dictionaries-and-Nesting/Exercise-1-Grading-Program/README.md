# Exercise 1 - Grading Program

## Instructions
You have access to a database of student scores in the format of a dictioanry. The keys in student scores are the names of the students and the valuse are their exam scores.

Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for valuse. The final version of the student grades dictionary will be checked.

This is the scoring criteria:
- Scores 91-100: Grade = "Outstanding"
- Scores 81-90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
- Scores 71-80: Grade = "Acceptable"
- Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"

## Expected Output
```
'{'Harry': 'Exceeds Expectations', 'Ron': 'Acceptable', 'Hermione': 'Outstanding', 'Draco': 'Acceptable', 'Neville': 'Fail'}'
```
