# Exercise 3 - Leap Year

## Instructions
Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year:
- On every year that is evenly divisible by 4.
- EXCEPT every year that is evenly divisible by 100.
- UNLESS the year is also evenly divisible by 400.

## Example Input 1
```
2400
```

## Example Output 1
```
Leap year.
```

## Example Input 2
```
1989
```

## Example Output 2
```
Not leap year.
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:
