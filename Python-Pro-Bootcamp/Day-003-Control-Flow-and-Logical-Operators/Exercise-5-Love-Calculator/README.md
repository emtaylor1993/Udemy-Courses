# Exercise 5 - Love Calculator

## Instructions
You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people. To work out the love score between two people:
- Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.
- Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
- Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

For Love Score **less than 10** _or_ **greater than 90**, the message should be:
```
"Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
```
For Love Scores **between 40** and **50**, the message should be:
```
"your score is **y**, you are alright together."
```
Otherwise, the message will just be their score.
```
"Your score is **z**."
```

## Example Input 1
```
name1 = "Kanye West"
name2 = "Kim Kardashian"
```

## Example Output 1
```
Your score is 42, you are alright together.
```

## Example Input 2
```
name1 = "Brad Pitt"
name2 = "Jennifer Aniston"
```

## Example Output 2
```
Your score is 73.
```

e.g. When you hit **run**, this is what should happen:
