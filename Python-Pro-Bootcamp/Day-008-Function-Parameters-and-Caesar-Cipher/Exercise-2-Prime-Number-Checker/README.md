# Exercise 2 - Prime Numbers

## Instructions
Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1. **You need to write a function** that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.

e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.

But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.
