# Exercise 3 - Life in Weeks

## Instructions
Create a program using math and f-strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format: You have x days, y weeks, and z months left. Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

**Warning:** Your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

## Example Input
```
56
```

## Example Output
```
You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
```
