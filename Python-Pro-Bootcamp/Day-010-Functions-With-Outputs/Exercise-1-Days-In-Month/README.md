# Exercise 1 - Days in Month

## Instructions
In the starting code, you'll find the solution from the Leap Year challenge. First, convert this function <code>is_leap()</code> so that instead of printing "Leap Year." or "Not Leap Year." it should return True if it is a leap lear and return False if it is not a leap year.

You are then going to create a function called <code>days_in_month()</code> which will take a year and a month as inputs. e.g.
```
days_in_month(year=2022, month=2)
```

And it will use this information to work out the number of days in the month, then return that as the output. e.g.
```
28
```

The List month_days contains the number of days in a month from January to December for a non-leap year. A lea[p year has 29 days in February.
