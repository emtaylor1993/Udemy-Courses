## Drawing with Java

The user can choose to draw a butterfly, elephant, bear, or snake.

```
System.out.﻿print﻿( "\nWhich animal would you like to draw?\n" )﻿;
System.out.﻿println﻿( "Write 1 for butterfly " )﻿;
System.out.﻿println﻿( "Write 2 for elephant  " )﻿;
System.out.﻿println﻿( "Write 3 for bear      " )﻿;
System.out.﻿println﻿( "Write 4 for snake     " )﻿;
```

## **Task 1: Pick up the user's choice.**

Using `Scanner`, pick up the user's choice.

## **Task 2: Write a function**

- Function name.

```java
/**
 * Function name: draw <-----
 * @param choice: (int)
 *
 * Inside the function:
 *  - Based on the choice, draw:
 *      1. a butterfly
 *      2. elephant
 *      3. bear
 *      4. snake
 */
```

- Parameters.

```java
/**

 *      2. elephant
 *      3. bear
 *      4. snake
 */
```

- Return value: `void`.

- Inside the function, draw one of the animals based on the user's choice.

```java
/**
 * Function name: draw
 * @param choice: (int)
 *
 * Inside the function:   <---------
 *  - Based on the choice, draw:
