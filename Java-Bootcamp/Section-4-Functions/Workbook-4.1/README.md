He needs to write this paragraph 6 times:<br>
<code>I will not copy and paste code.</code><br>
<code>I will use Camel Case when writing class names.</code><br>
<code>I will use lower Camel Case when writing function names.</code><br>
<code>I will use lower Camel Case when writing variables names.</code></br><br>

Bart wrote the paragraph once, but it took him a long time!

## Task 1: Write a Function
Help Bart write a function that does the task for him. The doc comment will guide you. 
A doc comment is embedded inside <code>/** ... **/</code>. They're best at describing the function name, parameters, and return value.

## Task 2: Call the Function
Once you finish writing it, call the function six times from <code>main()</code>.
