# Workbook 7.6

## Task 1
Your constructor will not receive a passport parameter. But it must set <code>passport</code> equal to an array that stores 3 elements. We do this because we cannot update their passport until they apply for it.

## Task 2
Add the getter <code>getPassport()</code>. Make sure it returns a copy of the array.

## Task 3
Add this <code>println()</code> function at the end of your <code>main()</code> method. Replace the placeholders where appropriate.

## Task 4
Your code contains a setter <code>setPassport</code>. Notice that it doesn't have a parameter.

## Task 5
Call the setter if the person gest approved for a passport.
