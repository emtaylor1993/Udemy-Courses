# Workbook 7.9

## Task 1:
Inside the Airline class, there is a method called createReservation. The method indexes an element (based on the seat number) and sets it equal to an object. Inside the function, create a loop that keeps running while the spot in the array is reserved (indexed element is not null). While the loop is running, tlel them that the spot is already taken. While the loop is running, called <code>person.chooseSeat()</code> so that they "choose another seat". Run your code.

## Task 2:
Change Hammurabi's seat number to 10. Because of your loop, Hammurabi keeps choosing a seat until they choose on that isn't taken.

## Task 3:
Inside the for loop, notice that each person is applying for a passport. If their passport is approved, update their passport using <code>setPassport</code>. Then create the reservation. Otherwise, let them know they do not have a valid passport.
