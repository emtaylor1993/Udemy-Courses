# Extra Practice - Contact Manager

## Task 1:
Create a new file named <code>Contact.java</code>. Inside the file, create the <code>Contact</code> class.

## Task 2:
Create a constructor that initializes the fields of a newly created object.

## Task 3:
Create a constructor that initializes a new object using an existing object's fields.

## Task 4:
Test your constructor by creating four instances of the Contact class.

## Task 5:
Use breakpoints to visualize the initialization of each field as objects are created.

## Task 6:
Test the copy constructor by creating two objects with fields copied from two existing objects.

## Task 7:
Use breakpoints to inspect field initialization in the new objects created using the copy constructor.
