# Hangman
Hangman is a word-guessing game. It keeps asking the user to guess characters until:
1. They guess every character correctly (win).
2. They miss 6 guesses (loss).

## Why is Hangman your Capstone Project?
- It's hard.
- It will effectively test your ability to apply concepts from Module One.
- It will challenge you to get creative and do some research. As a developer, it's important that you practice finding resources online.

## Tips Before You Start
- If you struggle building hangman, that's good! That means you will learn a lot by trying to solve it.
- As you're building hangman, you're likely going to get bugs (unexpected results). The best way to fix bugs is to use breakpoints.

# Instructions
Because this is your capstone project, the instrutions are less detailed. Unlike the workbooks and challenges, the instructions will only tell you what the task is. They will not explain or guide you toward completing the task.
Finally, I encourage you to read all of the instructions before starting your code.

## Task 1: Choose a Random Word
In the starter project, I left you an array of words. Your game must choose a random word from the list of words. The placeholders <code>'_'</code> in your game must reflect the number of characters in that word.

## Task 2: Show the Gallows
At every turn, you need to show the gallows. In your starter project, you'll find an array of: <code>String[] gallows</code>. Each <code>String</code> in the array reflects the number of times the user guessed incorrectly. This should be the output when the user misses two guesses.

## Task 3: Show Missed Guesses
You need to keep track of every incorrect guess the user made. This helps the user not make the same mistake twice.

## Task 4: Replace <code>placeholders</code> with Correct Guesses
When the user guesses correctly, replace the matching placeholders.

## Task 5A: If User Wins:
Stop the game. Example output of a winning game:

## Task 5B: If User Loses:
Stop the game. Example output of a losing game:
