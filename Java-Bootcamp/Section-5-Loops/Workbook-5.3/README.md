## Counting Tool
Timmy's having trouble counting. Let's build a Java app that will help him out.

## Task 1
Ask Timmy what number he'd like to count up to.

Make sure Timmy can enter the value **BESIDE** the question.

## Task 2
Count from 0 to that number. If Timmy enters 7, your app should output: <code>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7</code>
