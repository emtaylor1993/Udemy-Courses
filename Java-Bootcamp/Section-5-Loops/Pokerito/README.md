# Pokerito
Pokerito is like Poker, but the rules are a lot simpler.

## Task 1: Define Function
Create the function: <code>randomCard</code><br>
There are 13 cards that go from Ace(1) to King(13). Use <code>switch</code> to return a card that matches the random number. Call the function and print the return value.

## Task 2: Rules
Start the game by explaining the rules.

## Task 3: Draw Card
Once the user is ready, present them with a card. Also show them the computer's card.

## Task 4: Dealer's Turn
Print: <code>Now, the dealer will draw five cards. Press enter to continue.</code><br>
Use a <code>for</code> loop to draw a card every time the user presses enter. You must draw a total of 5 cards and print the order of each one.
