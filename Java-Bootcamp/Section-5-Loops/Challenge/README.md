## Task 5:
After you print your cards, print the hand value. The hand value is the sum of your card values. In blackjack, the face cards have values of 10.

## Task 6:
The dealer gets two cards as well. Print the dealer's first card, and print the next one facedown. You can find the <code>String</code> for a facedown card being returned from a function called: <code>faceDown()</code>
