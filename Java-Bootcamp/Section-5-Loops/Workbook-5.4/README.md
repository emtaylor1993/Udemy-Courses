# Workbook 5.4

## 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall
A song as old as time itself.

## Task 1: Write Function
Write a sing function that takes in an integer parameter for the number of bottles of beer on the wall.

## Task 2: For Loop
Make a <code>for</code> loop that:
- Starts from <code>i</code> = 99
- Finishes at <code>i</code> = 1
- Loops down in steps of 1

Call the function during each run. Your final output should start from 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
