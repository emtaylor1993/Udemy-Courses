# Global Superstore 2

**Prerequisite:** You wrote the solution for Workbook 1.


## Task 1

Place comments on the "Scanner" related code.

## Task 2

From the main thread, print the state of `thread2` when it's `NEW`.

## Task 3

From the main thread, print the state of `thread2` when it's `Runnable`.

## Task 4

From the main thread, print the state of `thread2` when it's `TERMINATED`.

Use `interrupt()` and `sleep()` to accomplish this task. For this task, you can only sleep the main thread for `10` milliseconds.

## Task 5

In preparation for Part 3:
 - Remove every call to `getState()`. 
 - Uncomment the `Scanner` related code.

## Good Luck!
