# Javapedia

Javapedia is a free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. As a world-renowned editor, your task is to submit information aobut famous historyical figures. Then, Javapedia will print the content from its database. Javapedia also lets the user search popular figures by name.

## Task 1
Ask the user: <code>How many historical figures will you register?</code> Store the value in an <code>int</code> variable.<br>

## Task 2
Make a 2D array named: <code>database</code>. The data we're going to submit will take the form of a table.<br>

So, our array must have as many rows as there are historical figures. Each row also needs 3 values. Don't populate the array yet. Leave that for Task 3.

## Task 3
Create a <code>for</code> loop that runs through every row in the database. The user needs to submit three values per row.

As the user submits each value, you need to store it in the appropriate row. While doing this task, be careful of the <code>nextLine</code> pitfall.

## Task 4
Print the contents of the <code>database</code>. Create a function called <code>print2DArray</code> and use it to print the database.<br>

## Task 5
The final task is to let the user search the database by name. If the search matches a name in <code>database</code>, print that row's information.
