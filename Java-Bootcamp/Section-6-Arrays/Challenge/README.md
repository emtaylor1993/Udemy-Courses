# Tic Tac Toe
This is the most exciting challenge in this course. You're going to build a two-player game of Tic Tac Toe!

## Task 1: Create Array
The Tic Tac Toe board is a grid with three rows. Each row has three <code>'_'</code> characters. Your first task is to store these characters in an array.

## Task 2: Print Array
Write a function that prints the board. Call the function after creating the board.

## Task 3: Take Turns
The maximum number of turns is 9. Set up a <code>for</code> loop that runs 9 times and prints the counter.

Each run represents a turn, such that X goes first.

Hint: X plays when the counter is even, where as O plays when the counter is odd. Set up a condition that alternates between printing Turn: X and Turn: O.

## Task 5: Populate Board
The funtion call returns the player's spot. Use that return value to index the board and populate it. Then, print the board.

## Task 4: Revisited
We can't let the player pick a spot that's already taken. Handle this condition.

## Final Result
